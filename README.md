# Canvass Foresight

Canvass Foresight is a data annotation tool meant to assist organizers in their canvassing efforts. It gives organizers the ability to narrow large sets of prospective addresses by being able to see what the address may look like before they try to send anyone to survey the address in person.

Leveraging collections of pre-fetched streetview images, organizers can review, label, and comment on them. It sits on top of a REST API connected to [NocoDB](https://nocodb.com/). NocoDB provides an open sourced and free UI for interacting with complex sets of spreadsheets, it is very similar to [Airtable](https://airtable.com/).

# Built For All

I created this tool to support the wonderful and radical gardens within Philadelphia in their struggles against unfair land and property practices, but realistically this tool can be applied to any dataset with minimal refactoring. My dream is to always build tools that enable strategic, scientific, and analytical struggles that empower communities to improve their social and economic conditions.

**Please re-use and build off of this project if you would like to!**
